# Buttons

## Getting Started With Buttons

There are a few types of buttons currently, and those are:

```
btn btn-primary
btn btn-secondary
btn btn-success
btn btn-warning
btn btn-danger
```

With other types to come!

Simply create a button by doing

```markup
<button class="btn btn-primary">This is Primary!</button> 
```

It will also work with some other elements, like the a element, the submit, and button input element!
